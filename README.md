##Overview

This repository contains a complete pipeline for classifying **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)** vs. **Cognitively Normal (CN)** subjects using functional connectivity (FC) derived from fMRI data.

The project explores two major modeling approaches:
1.  **Classical Machine Learning:** SVM and MLP using graph-theoretic features (Node Strength).
2.  **Deep Learning:** Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and DeepSets using full connectivity matrices.

##Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** ROI signal extraction and reduction (410 $\to$ 400 regions).
* **Connectivity Construction:**
    * Pearson Correlation.
    * Fisher Z-Transformation.
    * Percentile-based Thresholding (Top 26%).
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * **Vector Features:** Node Strength centrality for SVM/MLP.
    * **Graph Features:** $400 \times 400$ Adjacency Matrices for GNNs.
* **Classification:**
    * Linear SVM with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV).
    * Statistical Feature Selection (Welch's t-test).

##Repository Structure

The project is organized into modular scripts for reproducibility:
